I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at **[Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/)** interested in AI & HCI. My recent projects focused on uncertainty quantification and interface design for human-AI interaction.

I graduated with a master's degree from <a href="https://wustl.edu/" style="color: #a51417;">Washington University in St. Louis</a> and did my bachelor's at Southwest University (Chongqing, China). My prior research experiences involved uncertainty representation & reasoning, causal inference, and preference aggregation for decision support systems.
