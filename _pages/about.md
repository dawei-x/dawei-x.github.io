I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at **[Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/)**, working with **[Prof. Marcelo Worsley](https://www.mccormick.northwestern.edu/research-faculty/directory/profiles/worsley-marcelo.html)** in the **[tiilt Lab](https://tiilt.northwestern.edu/)** on designing and evaluating AI-augmented multimodal interactive systems. My current research focuses on developing multimodal fusion pipelines and intelligent analytics dashboards.

My recent projects include uncertainty quantification in human-AI interaction **[\[demo\]](https://dawei-x.github.io/stimuli_demo/)**, and interactive interfaces for assisting users with exploratory analysis [<i class="fas fa-link"></i>](https://dawei-x.github.io/rashomon/). My prior research also involved uncertainty representation & reasoning, causal inference, and preference elicitation & aggregation for decision support systems <strong><a href="https://dawei-x.github.io/ifv-prototype/" style="color:#976666;">[prototype]</a></strong>.
