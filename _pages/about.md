I'm a second-year Computer Science PhD student at **[Northwestern University](https://www.northwestern.edu/)** working on designing and evaluating interactive systems. My recent projects focused on uncertainty quantification in human-AI interaction **[\[demo\]](https://dawei-x.github.io/stimuli_demo/)**, and interactive interfaces for assisting users with exploratory analysis [\[in progress\]](https://dawei-x.github.io/rashomon/).

My prior research experiences involved uncertainty representation & reasoning, causal inference, and preference elicitation & aggregation for decision support systems **[\[prototype\]](https://dawei-x.github.io/ifv-prototype/)**.
